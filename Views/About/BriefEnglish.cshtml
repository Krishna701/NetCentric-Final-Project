                                                <p>Mandandeupur Municipality  is located in Kavrepalanchok District under Bagmati Pradesh of Nepal. It is located 55 km northeast of Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal. The municipality covers an area of &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;89 sq. Km. and consists of former Baluwapati Deupur, Garivisauna Deupur, Nayangaun Deupur, Mahadevsthan Mandan, Chandani Mandan, Jasithok Mandan, and Jamdi Mandan (1-4, 6) VDCs and seven VDCs together. 2073 Falgun 27 (10 March 2017) It came into existence after its publication in the Gazette yesterday. Madan Deupur Nagarpalika is bounded on the east by Bhamlu village municipality, on the west by Bhaktapur and Kathmandu, on the north by Sindhupalchowk district and on the south by Banepa and Panchkhal municipalities. The total population is 32,659 of which 15,320 are males and 17,339 are females. The sex ratio is 88.36 and the population density is 367 per sq km of this municipality.</p>
                                                <p>Madan Deupur Municipality is mainly inhabited by Hindus, Buddhists, and Christians. Brahmins, Chhetris, and Tamangs are in the majority here. The people here have been embracing agriculture, animal husbandry, and trade and tourism business as their main occupations. The proximity of Dhulikhel, Banepa, and Kathmandu Valley has had a direct positive impact on the economic, social, and cultural development of the municipality. Agricultural and livestock products produced here are mostly consumed and sold in the same market area. Geographically, the town has a moderately hilly terrain and is well-suited for human habitation and tourism.</p>
                                                <p>As Mandandeupur is the youngest newly formed municipality in Kavre district, the challenge of establishing it as a competent municipality has fallen on the shoulders of the entire city dwellers and government and non-government bodies. There is a need for a planned approach to turn the possibilities here into opportunities and reduce the problems that exist here.</p>
